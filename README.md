# G510.App.Twitch

With this project i want to create a simple app, for the Logitech G510 keyboard, that lets you track the current 
viewers a Twitch Channel.

The reason i published it is the horrible documentation of Logitech about the LogitechLed API, the "LogitechLed API" 
lets you control the backlight of the Keyboard.

[...]
\API Contract\Logitech_LCD_Pinvoke.cs is my workaround for the Logitech Api's.
